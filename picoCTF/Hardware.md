# 1: I like Logic
> i like logic and i like files, apparently, they have something in common, what should my next step be.
Included file: [challenge.sal](assets_hardware/challenge.sal)
## Solution:
- Looking up `.sal` tells us that it's a capture file from the *Salae Logic Analyser*, which I download the AppImage for and start up.
- Opening the included file in the software, we get something that looks like this:

- Just clicking around the interface, I stumble upon the `Analyzers` tab, whereupon clicking the `Terminal` output button, we find a huge block of text, with the flag in the middle.

## Flag:
`FCSC{b1dee4eeadf6c4e60aeb142b0b486344e64b12b40d1046de95c89ba5e23a9925}`
## Notes:
- Expected the challenge to be way more involved but I got lucky with this one.
